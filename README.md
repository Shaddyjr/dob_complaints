# NYC Building Complaints Inspection Estimator
This project attempts to build a tool that determines how long it will take for a submitted building complaint to be inspected/resolved.

## Executive Summary

## Problem Statement

## Data
The dataset used in this project is available from NYC Open Data at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Complaints-Received/eabe-havv. This database compiles all complaints entered in the city from 1989, and is updated daily. For the purposes of this project, the dataset used was downloaded on or around September 23, 2019 and had complaints entered until September 21, 2019. Ideally, this tool would have constant access to the live database for the purposes of updating and retraining the predictive model to stay relevant.
